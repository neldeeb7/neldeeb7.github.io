Nehal Eldeeb
I am a Social Welfare doctoral student at UC Berkeley focused on understanding engagement in evidence-based parenting programs to promote equity, effectiveness, and impact. My research interests include the prevention of child maltreatment, implementation science, and the effective dissemination of knowledge between researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and families.
