#Nehal Eldeeb
##A little about me: 
Nehal(knee-hail) in arabic means a stream of water that everyone can drink from and Eldeeb in arabic means "The Wolf". 
I am Egyptian-Canadian but I grew up in Qatar & Canada. I love to travel and learn about diverse cultures, people, and eat all the delicious food. I have been fortunate enough to have visited 20 countries and wish to travel more after graduate school. For my next trip, I wish to visit Tanzania and Zanzibar. 

##Research Interests
I am a Social Welfare doctoral student at UC Berkeley focused on understanding engagement in evidence-based parenting programs to promote equity, effectiveness, and impact. My research interests include the prevention of child maltreatment, implementation science, and the effective dissemination of knowledge between researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and families.
